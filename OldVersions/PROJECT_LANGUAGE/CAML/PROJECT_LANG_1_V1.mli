# About:
# I decided to make CAML the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-CAML) as CAML is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the CAML programming language. It only makes sense to CAML the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
